## Hello.

My name is **Dalton**, and this is my website.

By day, I work for **Match.com** where I lead the development of over 10 iOS apps, including **Chispa** and **BLK**. We work with cool things like **MVVM**, **RxSwift**, and **Firebase**.

By night, I like to learn and play. I have released numerous personal apps and games to the App Store, and published over twenty open-source projects on GitHub. My most popular project is **[TweenController](https://github.com/daltonclaybrook/tween-controller)**, which has been starred over 500 times, and has been featured in several blogs.

Here's what I've been playing with lately:

* Swift 4
* Vapor Web Framework
* Docker
* Amazon Web Services
* Ethereum Smart Contracts

In addition to writing software, I like to [write and play music](https://vimeo.com/51969508), brew beer, play Kerbal Space Program, and [hang out with my wife](https://www.instagram.com/p/BJ8UEi2AQnp/) and two cats.
